## Method 1: Via VS Code UI (Recommended)

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions view
3. **Click the "..." menu** (three dots) in the top right of the Extensions view
4. **Select "Install from VSIX..."**
5. **Navigate to:** `C:\Users\wattz\NexGen-Meta\ExtensionLens`
6. **Select:** `extensionlens-0.1.0.vsix`
7. **Click "Install"**
8. **Look for the ExtensionLens icon** in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)

## Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\wattz\NexGen-Meta\ExtensionLens`
3. Drag `extensionlens-0.1.0.vsix` directly into VS Code window
4. Click "Install" when prompted

## After Installation

1. **Look for the ExtensionLens icon** 🔍 in the Activity Bar
2. **Click it** to open the inspector
3. **Explore the tabs:**
   - Extensions - View all installed extensions
   - Commands - Browse all commands
   - Performance - Check activation times
   - Conflicts - Detect conflicts

## For Development (F5 Testing)

If you want to test/debug without installing:

2. Press `F5`
3. A new Extension Development Host window will open
4. ExtensionLens will be running in that window
